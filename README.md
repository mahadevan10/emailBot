# AI-Powered Job Application Email Bot

This project automates the process of drafting personalized job application emails using the latest in LLM technology (OpenAI + LangChain), React, and Flask.

## Features

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend:** Flask API for processing and orchestration.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Uses NLTK to extract keywords from job descriptions.
- **Resume Matching:** Matches extracted keywords with those found in your `resume.txt`.
- **LLM Drafting:** Uses LangChain and OpenAI to:
  1. Draft a professional email based on job description and matched resume keywords.
  2. Correct the draft by comparing it with your resume, ensuring only accurate information is included.
  3. Humanize the email to avoid typical LLM patterns (excessive formality, dashes, generic compliments), using contractions and a natural, authentic tone.
- **Editable Email:** Final email is editable in the frontend.
- **Send via Gmail:** One-click to open Gmail compose window with the drafted email.

## How It Works (Technical Details)

1. **Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS):**
   - Collects your email and job description.
   - Displays extracted keywords, matched resume keywords, and the drafted email.
   - Allows editing and sending the email via Gmail.

2. **Backend (Flask):**
   - Receives data from the frontend.
   - Uses NLTK to extract keywords from the job description (prefers "Requirements" section if present).
   - Matches these keywords with all words in your `resume.txt`.
   - Uses LangChain and OpenAI to:
     - Draft the initial email.
     - Correct the draft for accuracy using your resume.
     - Rewrite the email to sound more human and less like it was generated by an AI.

### How `skill_matcher.py` Works

The `skill_matcher.py` module is responsible for matching keywords extracted from the job description with words found in your resume.  
Currently, it works by:
- Reading the entire `resume.txt` file.
- Extracting all words (ignoring punctuation, numbers, and common headers).
- Comparing the extracted keywords from the job description with these resume words (case-insensitive).
- Returning a list of matched keywords.

**Current Implementation:**
```python
import re

def load_resume_keywords(resume_path):
    with open(resume_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
    # Extract all words (ignore punctuation, numbers, and common headers)
    words = re.findall(r'\b[a-zA-Z]{2,}\b', content)
    resume_keywords = set(word.lower() for word in words)
    return resume_keywords

def match_keywords_with_resume(keywords, resume_path):
    resume_keywords = load_resume_keywords(resume_path)
    matched = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in resume_keywords]
    return matched
```

#### How to Further Modify `skill_matcher.py`

- **Section-Based Matching:**  
  You can modify the matcher to only compare keywords with specific sections of your resume (e.g., "Skills", "Experience") for more targeted results.

- **Phrase Matching:**  
  Enhance the matcher to support multi-word phrases or skill sets (e.g., "machine learning", "web development").

- **Synonym Matching:**  
  Integrate NLP libraries like spaCy or WordNet to match synonyms and related terms, increasing the flexibility of keyword matching.

- **Weighted Matching:**  
  Assign weights to different sections or keywords to prioritize certain skills or experiences.

- **Custom Stopwords:**  
  Exclude common words or customize the stopword list to improve matching relevance.

Feel free to adapt the matcher logic to best fit your resume format and application needs!

## Setup

### Backend

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your OpenAI API key to a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the backend:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
