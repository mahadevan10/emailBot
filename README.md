# AI-Powered Job Application Email Bot

This project automates the process of drafting personalized job application emails using the latest in LLM technology (OpenAI + LangChain), React, and Flask.

## Features

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend:** Flask API for processing and orchestration.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Uses NLTK to extract keywords from job descriptions.
- **Resume Matching:** Matches extracted keywords with those found in your `resume.txt`.
- **LLM Drafting:** Uses LangChain and OpenAI to:
  1. Draft a professional email based on job description and matched resume keywords.
  2. Correct the draft by comparing it with your resume, ensuring only accurate information is included.
  3. Humanize the email to avoid typical LLM patterns (excessive formality, dashes, generic compliments), using contractions and a natural, authentic tone.
- **Editable Email:** Final email is editable in the frontend.
- **Send via Gmail:** One-click to open Gmail compose window with the drafted email.

## How It Works (Technical Details)

1. **Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS):**
   - Collects your email and job description.
   - Displays extracted keywords, matched resume keywords, and the drafted email.
   - Allows editing and sending the email via Gmail.

2. **Backend (Flask):**
   - Receives data from the frontend.
   - Uses NLTK to extract keywords from the job description (prefers "Requirements" section if present).
   - Matches these keywords with all words in your `resume.txt`.
   - Uses LangChain and OpenAI to:
     - Draft the initial email.
     - Correct the draft for accuracy using your resume.
     - Rewrite the email to sound more human and less like it was generated by an AI.

## Setup

### Backend

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your OpenAI API key to a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the backend:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
